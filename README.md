# Type Ahead ðŸ‘€

A simple web application that provides type-ahead functionality for searching cities and states.

## Description

This project consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure and content of the web page. The CSS file (`style.css`) contains the styles and layout for the page elements. The JavaScript file (`app.js`) implements the logic for fetching city data, searching and filtering the data based on user input, and displaying the matching results.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

2. Enter a city or state name in the search input.

3. The application will display a list of matching cities or states as you type.
